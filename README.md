# meteor-wysihtml5
A Meteor package wrapper for the wysihtml5 editor

wysihtml5 is an open source rich text editor based on HTML5 technology and the progressive-enhancement approach.
It uses a sophisticated security concept and aims to generate fully valid HTML5 markup by preventing unmaintainable tag soups and inline styles.
The code is completely library agnostic: No jQuery, Prototype or similar is required.
